# Rocket Feedback application

### Vision:

###### This project is to produce an application where students can fill out a survey/feedback form. The project is made for university students to communicate their feedback and concerns to teachers. After each lesson the students will fill out a form about the lesson and send it to their course teacher.

### Problem statement:

###### Users in our target demographic, in this case meaning students, often struggle with voicing their opinions about lectures and courses. Whether these issues are about the learnt subject, teaching style or just a suggestion for improvement etc. students would greatly benefit from having a safe anonymous avenue where to express their concerns and opinions.
